  * src/lexer-input-stream.lisp: improved performance by using flexible double
  buffer strings

2010-07-26  Alexander Kahl <e-user@fsfe.org>

  * src/lexer-input-stream.lisp, test/lexer-input-stream.lisp: fixed lexer
  col/row calculation finished decent lexing test

  * src/lexer-input-stream.lisp, test/lexer-input-stream.lisp: test/code fixing
  unreading

  * test/common.lisp, test/lexer-input-stream.lisp: test for tokenization

  * src/lexer-input-stream.lisp: added decent restart descriptions

  * test/common.lisp, test/fixtures/chinese, test/fixtures/esperanto,
  test/fixtures/latin, test/lexer-input-stream.lisp: cut down test runs by
  using only three different buffer sizes and much shorter test fixtures
  unreading test for lexers

  * graylex-test.asd, test/buffered-input-stream.lisp, test/common.lisp,
  test/fixtures/chinese, test/fixtures/esperanto, test/fixtures/latin,
  test/lexer-input-stream.lisp: refactoring three text fixtures (chinese,
  esperanto and latin texts) > 1.1M assertions (maybe a bit too much)
