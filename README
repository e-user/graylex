graylex - Gray lexer input streams
==================================
graylex offers a means to do string operations on input streams without slurping
all input at once by using Common Lisp Gray Streams, fixed-sized and flexible
buffers.

This is especially interesting for lexical analysis ("lexing") [1] where input
files can be exuberant, e.g. SQL dumps weighing hundreds of Megabytes.

graylex is completely written in Common Lisp and licensed under the
GPLv3+[2]. Please see the file COPYING in the top-level directory of the
distribution tarball or see the link at [2] if you didn't receive a copy along
with this file.


Installation
============
Please see file INSTALL.


Usage
=====
Please see file m4-lexer.lisp in subdirectory examples for a self-explanatory
real-world example.


History
=======
graylex is inspired by dso-lex [3] but tackles two shortcomings of other lexing
libraries including dso-lex:
- Lexing and parsing should be performed on streams (i.e. string chunks of a
  stream) which can be a tedious task to implement manually
- There are languages where the grammar [4] is volatile and the set of terminals
  [5] changes during immediate evaluation, hence eval'ing dynamically scoped
  variables is necessary (e.g. M4)
