graylex - Gray lexer input streams
==================================
graylex offers a means to do string operations on input streams without slurping
all input at once by using Common Lisp Gray Streams, fixed-sized and flexible
buffers.

This is especially interesting for lexical analysis ("lexing") [lex] where input
files can be exuberant, e.g. SQL dumps weighing hundreds of Megabytes.

graylex is completely written in Common Lisp and licensed under the
GPLv3+ [gpl]. Please see the file COPYING in the top-level directory of the
distribution tarball or see the link at [2] if you didn't receive a copy along
with this file.


Installation
------------
Please see file INSTALL.


Usage
-----
Please see file examples/graylex-m4-example.lisp for a self-explanatory
real-world example.


History
-------
graylex is inspired by dso-lex [dso-lex] but tackles two shortcomings of other
lexing libraries including dso-lex:
- Lexing and parsing should be performed on streams (i.e. string chunks of a
  stream) which can be a tedious task to implement manually
- There are languages where the grammar [grammar] is volatile and the set of
  terminals [term] changes during immediate evaluation, hence eval'ing
  dynamically scoped variables is necessary (e.g. M4)
